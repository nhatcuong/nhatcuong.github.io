Hi there, my name's Nhat Cuong, and I also go by Nathan.

I am currently a Software Engineer working in a cross path between Data Pipelines, Statistics, Experimentation, and ML Productionization.

So far in my career, I've been working in a startup, an SME and a big corp. I also happened to manage a small team.

I write to give my thoughts and learnings about Technology and Productivity for Engineers. Hope you find them useful!
